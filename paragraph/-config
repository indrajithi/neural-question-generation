**onmt.translate.lua**

  -config          Read options from this file []

**Data options**

  -src             Source sequence to decode (one line per sequence) []
  -par             Paragraph sequence to decode (one line per sequence) []
  -tgt             True target sequence (optional) []
  -output          Path to output the predictions (each line will be the decoded sequence [pred.txt]
  -attn_output     Path to output the attention matrix of predictions []
  -model           Path to model .t7 file []

**Beam Search options**

  -beam_size       Beam size [5]
  -batch_size      Batch size [30]
  -max_sent_length Maximum sentence length. If any sequences in srcfile are longer than this then it will error out [250]
  -replace_unk     Replace the generated UNK tokens with the source token that
                              had the highest attention weight. If phrase_table is provided,
                              it will lookup the identified source token and give the corresponding
                              target token. If it is not provided (or the identified source token
                              does not exist in the table) then it will copy the source token [false]
  -phrase_table    Path to source-target dictionary to replace UNK
                                     tokens. See README.md for the format this file should be in []
  -n_best          If > 1, it will also output an n_best list of decoded sentences [1]

**Other options**

  -gpuid           1-based identifier of the GPU to use. CPU is used when the option is < 1 [0]
  -fallback_to_cpu If = true, fallback to CPU if no GPU available [false]
  -time            Measure batch translation time [false]
